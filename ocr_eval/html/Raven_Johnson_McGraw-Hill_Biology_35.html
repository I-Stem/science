This condensation reaction is called a dehydration synthesis, because the removal of the -OH group and H during the synthesis of a new molecule in effect constitutes the removal of a molecule of water (H2O). For every subunit that is added to a macromolecule, one water molecule is removed. Energy is required to break the chemical bonds when water is extracted from the subunits, so cells must supply energy to assemble macromolecules. These and other biochemical reactions require that the reacting substances be held close together and that the correct chemical bonds be stressed and broken. This process of positioning and stressing, termed catalysis, is carried out in cells by a</p><p id=3>special class of proteins known as enzymes. Cells disassemble macromolecules into their constituent</p><p id=4>subunits by performing reactions that are essentially the reverse of dehydration-a molecule of water is added instead of removed (figure 3.3b). In this process, which is called hydrolysis (Greek hydro, "water" + lyse, "break"), a hydrogen atom is attached to one subunit and a hydroxyl group to the other, breaking a specific covalent bond in the macromolecule. Hydrolytic reactions release the energy that was stored in the bonds that were broken.</p></span><span idx = 2><h6>Column 2</h6><p id=1>Table 3.1 Macromolecules FIGURE 3.3 Making and breaking H2 O macromolecules. a) Biological HO - - H HOY H macromolecules are polymers formed by Energy linking subunits together.
