Now you can wipe that smudge off and improve your appearance before the important event. Metaphorically, every question you get wrong is such a mirror-a chance to look at yourself, remove the smudge, and improve your understanding.</p><p id=2>Our study plans are designed with this in mind. We have you jump into mixed content questions right away, well before you have a chance to complete all the Magoosh video lessons. One reason is, of course, that the GRE itself will throw nothing but mixed content at you, and we want you to get comfortable with this "gear- switching" as early in your study process as possible. That being said, we know this means you'll probably get many questions wrong at the beginning, and we believe this is a good thing. Obviously, we aren't trying to punish you or make you feel bad about yourself. Rather, we know that making mistakes and consciously reflecting on these mistakes is exactly what will prime your mind for the content of the video lessons. It takes a good deal of confidence and emotional security to adopt this attitude-to look beyond the frustration of getting questions wrong, and to embrace, with courage and optimism, the opportunity for self-improvement in each mistake. In the face of an apparent lack of success, it's very hard to maintain any sort of courageous optimism. It takes a very strong and secure individual who can say, "I've gotten two hundred GRE questions wrong so far, and that's great, because from those mistakes I have learned two hundred new concepts that I can use!" But remember, if you want to stand out, you must be a standout. If you want extraordinary results, you need an extraordinary perspective. Wherever you are in your GRE preparation, that's exactly the kind of success we wish for you.</p><h1>Beating Exam Stress</h1><p id=2>If you're already overwhelmed with anxiety about the test, in addition to studying, you should focus on managing that stress. To combat this problem, you may want to try to make future mock tests as stressful as possible. For instance, when you're giving yourself a practice test, don't stand up except at the appointed breaks of the exam. Maybe even turn on the television in the background just so you can learn to cope with distractions. Another important way of coping with stress is to notice your breathing. When</p><p id=3>we become stressed, our breath becomes shallower and our bodies tense up. You can ease stress by taking longer, deeper breaths. Just a few deep breaths should calm your nerves and help restore your breathing and, most importantly, your focus.</p><h1>Tips to Study More Effectively</h1><p id=3>When you're trying to focus on studying, and especially when you're following a pretty intense study plan, it can feel like the whole world is trying to distract you.</p><p id=4>Between texts from friends, social media messages from family, and adorable pictures of kittens, it can be hard to stay true to the study schedule. 9</p></span><body></html>
