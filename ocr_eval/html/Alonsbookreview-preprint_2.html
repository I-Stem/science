Most of these books [e. g ., 1; 2; 3; 4; 5]1 emphasize the analysis of "omic" experimental data and/or large-scale mathematical modeling so as to describe how biological systems work at the molecular level. While this is doubtlessly a very important problem in biology, the object of this review - Uri Alon (2007). "An introduction to systems biology: design principles of biological circuits" London: Chapman & Hall/CRC (ISBN 1584886420, GBP 30.99, 320 pp) - focuses</p><p id=10>1 This is just a list of books I happened to have the occasion to consult recently. It is neither the result of a systematic survey of the literature on systems biology or an implicit endorsement of these books.</p></span><body></html>
