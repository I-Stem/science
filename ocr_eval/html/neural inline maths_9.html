Bar charts comparing all the baseline and proposed methods for macro average and micro average are shown in Figures 5 and 6 respectively. We can observe that our proposed method F-Measure is performing better than all other baseline approaches.</p><p id=5>As we aim to achieve better evaluation results for minor classes (B-Math and I-Math), in this section, we will discuss the scores of each class in detail. The top three methods which are performed best according to the F-Measure (as described in Table 3) are analysed further. The class- specific performance evaluation of different models is shown in Table 4. Results of the Conditional Random Fields (CRF2) model are shown in Table 4. For all the evaluation metrics (precision, recall, f-measure) the score for O-Math class is around 99% which is expected because O-Math class has large number of training instances. For both B-Math and I-math classes, precision is better than recall. F-measure is better for the I-Math class compared to the B-Math class. BIMExD results are shown in Table 5. The performance behaviour for the O-Math class in this method is similar to the behaviour for the O-Math class in the CRF method. Precision is better than recall for both B-Math and I-Math classes. In BIMExD, F- Measure for the I-Math class is higher compared to the B-Math class.</p></span><body></html>
