Possible reasoning<br> behind this is that the model retains the benefits of the carefully selected features (as done in CRF-2) and the automated feature engineering<br> (as done in BIMEXD), and the combination leads to better performance. The feature based model CRF-2 had a poor recall for the B-Math class,<br> which indicates that the features were not able to detect many actual B-Math instances. Since the precision of O-Math is almost 100%, some<br> of these false negatives for B-Math are actually being detected as I-Math-which may still be Ok as the complete chain of the mathematical<br> expressions will still be detected. Performance for O-Math class is boosted even further, and all examples for this class are successfully<br> detected by the method, resulting in a 100% recall. CRF2 precision is higher than the precision of HIMExD for B-Math class and BIMEXD recall<br> is better than recall of HIMExD for I-Math class. However, HIMEXD is better than CRF2 and BIMExD models in terms of F-measure for all the<br> classes. Overall, the proposed neural methods (BIMEXD and HIMEXD) achieve significantly better performances over the baseline approaches<br> taken from literature.<body></html>
