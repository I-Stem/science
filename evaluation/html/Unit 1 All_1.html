Describe the microanatomical composition of gray matter and white matter in the CNS.</p><h1>TUTORIAL OUTLINE</h1><p id=6>1. Functional microanatomy of neurons A. general features of neurons 1. Neurons are the fundamental unit of function in the CNS 2 . possess all cellular and metabolic machinery common to all other somatic cells (see Figure 1.32) 3 . but they are distinguished from most other somatic cells by their:</p><ol type=A start= 1><li>  rich diversity in morphology (shape)</li><li>  bioelectrical properties (they generate electrical signals)</li><li>  specializations for intercellular communication</li></ol><p id=6>B. survey of neuronal microanatomy (see Figure 1.2) 1. cell body, also called a soma (= "body"; plural = somata)</p><ol type=A start= 1><li>  contains nucleus, nucleic acids, and the usual organelles</li><li>  typically, neurons are very active metabolically in order to support</li></ol><p id=6>neural signaling and the synthetic requirements that are necessary to maintain the intricate protoplasmic processes that arise from neuronal somata</p><p id=7>1 Visit BrainFacts.org for Neuroscience Core Concepts (@2012 Society for Neuroscience ) that offer fundamental principles about the brain and nervous system, the most complex living structure known in the universe.
