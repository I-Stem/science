In addition, there are two timed essay-writing assignments in the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) section of the GRE. The experimental section won't count toward your score, but you won't know which section is the experimental one. You should treat all sections like they're the real deal. Both the overall GRE Verbal and GRE Quantitative scores can range from 130 to 170. The essays are scored from 0 to 6 in half-point increments.</p><p id=2>Number of questions and time limit The GRE Quantitative sections contain twenty questions each.
